We may want a fresh system when what we have is terrible, but the configurations will make most of us terrified and stick to the existing defective ones.

And we will forget what we installed into our system with more and more softwares and programs added to it. And maybe one year's latter, we will forget how to `install nvidia into ubuntu14` again and spend another half day to search the Internet.

So, notes about what we have done to our system and how these are done can be helpful. And some neat tools will make our life easier.

This repository will record what I add to fresh windows and ubuntu as time goes on.
