# Command

There are some useful commands.

* `nautilus` open the file folder
* `xdg-open` opens a file or URL in the user's preferred application

# Alternative tools

Since I use windows a lot and I already have nice develop suite set up there, and when come into the Linux world, some alternative tools would be appealing, and there is a website for such thing: [alternativeto.net](http://alternativeto.net/).

[cboxdoerfer/fsearch](https://github.com/cboxdoerfer/fsearch), alternative for `everything`.
